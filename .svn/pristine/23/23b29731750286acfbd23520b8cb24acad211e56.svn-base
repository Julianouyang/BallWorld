HW05: Command-dispatching BallWorld with Inter-ball Interactions

Team members: Julian Ouyang, Dapeng Shan

This composition-based BallWorld demonstrates the ability of composition-based systems to add dynamically modifiable behaviors to a system.

1. Type the name of a update strategy into the text field on the left.  See the list below for the available strategies.  
2. Clicking the "Add to Lists" button will then add it to both the drop lists.
3. "Make Selected Ball" will make a ball with the strategy selected on the top drop list.
4. "Combine!" will dynamically create a strategy that is the combination of the strategies selected on top and bottom lists. 
5. The new strategy is placed back into both drop lists and can be used again for combining. For instance, add then combine "Curve" and "Breathing" to make a ball that curves and breathes.
6. "Make Switcher" will make a ball, initially, ones that go straight.  
7. Clicking "Switch!" will cause all Switcher balls ever made to switch behaviors to whatever is the selected strategy on the top drop list. 
8. Switcher balls made later will have the same behavior as whatever the previously made Switchers have.
9. Type the name of a paint strategy into the text field on the left.  See the list below for the available strategies. 
10. Clicking the "Add" button will then add it to both the drop lists.
11. This additional function can change the original ball shape into more complicated painting. 

If you hold the mouse over any button, a tooltip will pop up that will tell you what that button does.


The following different types of strategies are available for use:

1. Straight
2. Curve
3. Color
4. Wander
5. Collide
6. Kill
7. Eat
8. Lazer
9. ChangeColor
10.ChangeToFish

However, strategies 6-10 should only be available to collide balls.

The following paint strategies are available for use:

1. Ball(Simple geometric shape with affine transformation)
2. Square(Non-affine transform-based paint strategy)
3. Ellipse(Simple geometric shape with affine transformation)
4. NiceFish(Composite shape that stays upright)
5. SoccerImage(Image)
6. PlanetImage(Image)
